# 🚀 Lunar Lander Reinforcement Learning Model

## 📌 Project Overview
This project implements **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** to train an AI agent to land a spacecraft in the OpenAI Gym **Lunar Lander** environment. The model utilizes **Deep Q-Networks (DQN)** and other deep learning-based RL techniques to optimize the landing process.

## 📊 Features
- Uses **Deep Q-Learning (DQN)** for training the AI agent.
- Implements **reward-based training** to enhance landing efficiency.
- Evaluates model performance with **visualized learning curves**.
- Fine-tunes hyperparameters for improved stability and accuracy.

## 🛠️ Installation
### **1️⃣ Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Lunar-Lander-RL.git
cd Lunar-Lander-RL
```

### **2️⃣ Install Dependencies**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### **3️⃣ Run the Model**
```bash
python lunar_lander_rl.py
```

## 🎮 How It Works
- The agent receives **state inputs** (position, velocity, angle, leg contact sensors).
- It takes **discrete actions** (do nothing, fire left/right engine, fire main engine).
- The agent learns via **Q-learning**, updating rewards and policies over episodes.
- The model is trained using **experience replay** and **target networks** for stability.

## 📈 Results
- Improved landing success rate over episodes.
- Visualizations of reward accumulation and model performance.

## 🔗 Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- OpenAI Gym
- TensorFlow / PyTorch
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## 🏆 Future Improvements
- Implement **Double DQN and Dueling DQN** for better convergence.
- Experiment with **Policy Gradient Methods**.
- Optimize training efficiency with **parallel environments**.
