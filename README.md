# Lunar-Lander-RL-Model
This project uses Reinforcement Learning (RL) to train an AI agent to land a spacecraft in the OpenAI Gym Lunar Lander environment. The model leverages Deep Q-Networks (DQN) and other deep learning-based RL techniques for optimal landing strategies.    ðŸ”¹ Key Concepts: Reinforcement Learning, Q-learning, Policy Optimization
